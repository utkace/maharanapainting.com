					<h2> About him</h2>
					<p>
						Mr. Ganga Narayan Maharana who was born in 1967 hails from the state of Orissa. Since his childhood he nurtured a dream of painting and making innovations in art. Inspite of some initial resistance for his family he pursued art with passion, as he got
						constant inspiration from his mother Smt. Manorama Maharana. He has many solo exhibitions to his credit and group shows at India Habitat Centre, Triveni Art Centre, Lalit Kala Academy and many more prestigious art galleries. Presently he is working
						as Art teacher at Apeejay School. He guides many new budding artists to achieve their goals. Many of his students get selected in Fashion Design and Interior College of Art and Polytechnique.<br> Mr. Maharana has a great vision towards society
						especially in the field of art. He saw a number of street children making paintings on the banks of trees and on other sources. This sparked a desire in him to nurture the talent of these children by establishing a NGO. Art is a gift of nature and
						any child acquiring this gift by birth must be nurtured. In this changing scenario of a fast paced world people are forgetting the essense of beauty of art. Mr. Maharana in his unusual way is trying to take these underpriveleged children into the
						mainstream of society.<br> In early 1990 Mr. Maharana shifted to Delhi on the advise of his brother who is himself a talented musician. Without any fixed job Mr. Maharana used to spend almost all the time at bus stops, railway stations, making sketches.
						He was spotted by an advertising agency owner, who immediately kept him. He was however doing commercial art, something that did not satisfy him. In 1993 he had the chance of being selected by APJ school as their arts teacher. Sitting among young
						children and teaching them, he started realising what his aim and goal in life should be.<br> In order to spend all his time with children he started "Manorama School of Fine Arts" with a soesstring budget. His only passion now was to reach out
						to young budding artists. Eight years of toil and sweat have borne fruit and today his "SEEDLINGS" are a group of enthusiastic, creative and dedicated child artists. Mr. Maharanah has only recieved support from the parents of the children who have
						been equally keen to inspire their their children. MSFA very successfully put up an exhibition "SEEDLING" in 2003 and then the journey began!
